Good job Agent Wilson, we're getting closer! But the hacking group is one step ahead 
still. Looks like we have a safe here but we need the password to crack it! we have the 
password file but we left it in the previous room. Also, opening the safe 
should hopefully shed some light on how to get into room 3!

If only there was some way to bring the hidden password file from that folder to this one!
